# Eat Da Burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


# Technology
express: http://expressjs.com/
<br>handlebars: https://handlebarsjs.com/
<br>mysql: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql

# Functionality
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
